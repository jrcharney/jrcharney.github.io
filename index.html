                <h2>Welcome to Something New</h2>
                <p class="date">March 8, 2020</p>
                <p>A few days ago I started <a href="./html-me-something">an assignment</a> for a <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a> class which helped push me to finally build this website that is long overdue.</p>
                <p>The structure of this site is a bit weird considering I plan on finally working on that <a href="./hacktop">Hacktop</a> page that had advertised on the back of my Hacktop the past few years. That page is part of this repository. However, my <a href="./LaunchCodeNotes">Launch Code Notes</a> and that one assignment are part of a different repository.  I'll need to see how I can merge at least one of those projects into this one later.</p>
                <p>The thing about using GitHub Pages is that they run on Jekyll. So I'm not sure how I'm going to pencil in any of the Node.js I am learning if I can't use my website and if I probably can't use Github Pages either.</p>
                <p>I could always try to use <a href="https://repl.it/@JRCharney">Repl.it</a>. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
                <p>At any rate, thanks for visiting. Big things are coming here soon.</p>
