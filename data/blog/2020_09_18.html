<h2>Why I Won't Work for Your Unethical, Cheating, Lying, Trump-backing Corporation</h2>
<p class="date">September 18, 2020</p>
<p>While I do hope for an apprenticeship post-Liftoff, the global (mostly American) crisis continues to reveal truths about a lot of companies looking for tech workers and how most of them have a piss-poor understanding of technology, more so if the first time they ever used Zoom was back in March 2020. (If there is any takeaway from one of my previous employers, it is that we used Zoom up to two years in advance.) There are global corporations that handle trillions of dollars and can be easily felled because reading a simple text file was too much for even the most well paid upper-management.</p>
<p>And yet, the crisis continues to be lead by people who follow a false narrative that things will go away on their own. That if problems are ignored, they will eventually go away.  That it is easier to believe in our cognitive biases than it is to believe scientific facts.</p>
<p>I joined LaunchCode to an effort to put use my social skills, to network with other people, to demonstrate my skill set.  Without the in-person interaction of other people, the efforts of working on a team project mean having to be on my own, work on my own, argue with family over the location of my workspace in the house on my own.</p>
<p>At the same time, this crisis has helped identify who best to work for and what some companies will do in times of great tragedy and chaos as well as their response to what happens when a product defective or a service is insecure.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, behavioral interviews will start.  I've managed to breeze through technical interviews (most of which have softball tech questions running on websites with poor craftsmanship), but the behaviorals rely on soft (social) skills, networking, and uneven levels of ethics.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, I have done what I can to avoid working for such companies as they ruin other companies, corrupt the systems, or corrupt themselves. Rarely do we see prison time for people with such wealth as they sit in front of a committee and lie straight to their faces about the responsibility and accountability.</p>
<p><b>The Boeing Corporation</b> is one such corporation, and the disasters of the 787 jets where hundreds died in separate crashes, a few engineers were prevented from talking of defects, managers wanted to continue making defective products, and another industry suffered greatly because the orders for hundreds of aircraft of the same make and model had already been fulfilled and now have airports full of these defective aircraft that now sit on the tarmac and in hangers unable to conduct business. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/boeing-pilots-texted-737-max-issues-years-crashes/story?id=66378430">And they knew all along.</a></p>
<p>If that is with commerical aircraft, imagine what Boeing is making for our military and the people who defend our country. Oh, wait, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html">they</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/broken-boeing-airplanes-are-going-military-thanks-corruption-bad-decisions-ncna1153671">already</a> <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-cutting-costs-is-expensive-how-9-hour-software-engineers-cost-boeing-billions-b76dbe571957">do</a>.</p>
<p>There are well on their way to being the next Enron or @Home (which ruined <a href="https://www.excite.com/">Excite.com</a>) or WorldCom (R.I.P. MCI).  But like a lot of other companies I'm mentioned in this post, brand name recognition keeps them from going out of business despite their unethical business practices.</p>
<p>It's why there is an <b>AT&amp;T</b> that owns WarnerMedia despite the fact that they have plenty of <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/at-t-skyscraper-a-vacant-44-story-office-building-in-downtown-st-louis-may-have/article_ea71dedf-79ef-5be1-9c9b-ce1406366fec.html">property</a> in <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160817/CRED03/160819886/lender-prepares-to-foreclose-on-former-at-t-campus-in-hoffman-estates">receivership</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/at-and-t-layoffs-jobs-slashed-trump-tax-cuts">laid off 37,000 Communications Workers of America union member</a>, but for some reason despite having a terrible credit and spending billions on corporate lobbying to dismantle network neutrality (and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191003/08115943112/surprise-buzzfeed-links-bogus-net-neutrality-comments-directly-to-broadband-industry.shtml">abused the FCC's request for comments on Net Neutrality with so many fake comments</a>), they still got a loan to buy a large media company (and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-t-got-a-giant-tax-cut-but-has-laid-off-thousands-union-says/">a $42 BILLION tax cut</a>), rebrand it, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190911/09231942968/some-investors-are-fed-up-with-atts-costly-obsession-with-merger-mania.shtml">still lose money have have nothing to show for it</a> (which <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/08/heres-why-hbo-max-peacock-arent-on-roku-fire-tv-1234580129/">they should have made apps for Roku and Amazon Fire for HBOMax instead</a> of advertising shows with things like <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/hbo-max-close-enough-releasing-edible-cannabis-gummies-kanha-/">cannibus-infused candy</a>, if that isn't a red flag for wasting a ton of money!), and have the audacity to announce plan to offer a discount service injected with advertisements, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamers-are-furious-about-new-mid-stream-ads-t-1845064792">that worked <i>so well</i> for Twitch recently. (NOT!)</a> Oh, and did they mention the cheaper plan will also mean <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/att-wants-to-put-ads-on-your-smartphone-in-exchange-for-5-discount/"><b>less privacy</b></a>. (The EFF is going to love that! #sarcasm) And if that weren't enough, <a href="https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-Pays-FCC-1825-Million-to-Settle-IP-Relay-Fraud-Claims-124180">engaged in an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> Relay Scam hat stole money from a program that helps the deaf and hard of hearing.</a></p>
<p>I'm not paying $104 per month on a four year old phone with a cracked screen that keeps reminding me its running out of storage space (because app developers can't fix the software bloat problems) just so I can get my internet hijacked by the My Pillow guy, and neither should you! But that's getting off topic and we can talk about using <a href="https://openvpn.net/">VPN</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">making a device to block that crap</a>, or better yet <a href="https://www.pivpn.io/">solve both of those problems</a>, in another post.</p>
<p>The whole point of sharing this information is to point out that when these two companies come to me in the near future and ask if I want to work for them, I will be firm in my position when I tell them to go screw themselves.</p>
<p>And you should too!</p>
<p>These are corporations who took advantage of people on the assumption that because their victims were not Americans, like me, that they didn't matter. These are corporations that campaign that they are inclusive of those with disabilities and yet they pay them less than someone who is not disabled or the take advantage of programs that are supposed to assist people with disabilities by using them to engage in fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p>They can pay all the money they want for an out-of-court settlement with non-disclosure agreements covered with as many stock images of people with Down's Syndrome all they want (because heave forbid there are any other kinds of disabilities that don't have any physical attributes), and it still won't be at all acceptable to try to cover up the infractions they commit against strangers for their own selfishness and greed.</p>
<p>And by golly, anyone who does this exact such cruelties shouldn't have to wait for death to go to hell but have every day they live be even worse than hell.</p>
<p>So what if the job is as a low level apprenticeship.  Every job matters, and if the upper-management is not held to the same accountability at the company as some underpaid disabled scab, then (other than money) why should we even permit them to take part of this program?</p>
<p>I'll admit, I did have an interest in working for the phone company at some point. The phone company whose name was Southwestern Bell. Who paid their mortgage on the skyscraper they build in 1986, and didn't think of ruining their services by reducing privacy, taking advantage of the disabled, and injecting rotten DNS packets that served advertising or scraped for personal data to sell to a third party to fund their illegal lobbying campaigns that included "cramming".</p>
<p>But that company is dead. In its place in downtown St. Louis, at 9th and Chestnut, is a 44-story tall vacant building which serves as a tombstone for corporate ethics.</p>
<p>So if you want me to work for you, even as an apprentice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Don't be like those companies.</li>
    <li>Don't <i>be</i> those companies.</li>
    <li>Never <i>ever</i> take advantage of the downtroten or disabled. (And don't pretend that you do!)</li>
    <li>An pay your employees at least every two weeks all the wages they earned.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can do any of those things, and be a <b>Responsible Functioning Mature Adult</b>, you don't deserve any of my respect or time.</p>
<p>You expect employees to be of the best behavior and standing. I shouldn't expect less from any company looking for employees to do the same.</p>
