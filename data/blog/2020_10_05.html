<h2>X-Day and Pivoting</h2>
<p class="date">October 5, 2020</p>
<p>I'm going to level with you. My project right now is a mess. Even this blog is a mess! I was going to allow for viewing items by post, but I forgot what I was going to write in the file. So I guess I will just have to push the parts that I do have.</p>
<p>Despite having not a whole lot to show for in Lightning, I have managed to learn a lot recently. Like how to properly use routing. Like why Express might be a better option than using Angular (for now). Like why TypeScript is still worth using over JavaScript. Like why using CommonJS style modules (<code>exports</code> and <code>require()</code>) is still better that the JavaScript style modules (<code>export</code> and <code>import</code>) which for some reason never work.  Like why using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> is under appreciated. Like knowing <a href="http://vimregex.com/">regular expression</a> is a mandatory skill. And why even if you fail, so as long as you can help others with their projects, by checking their code when they need help, or sharing your knowledge, and writing your own notes (with <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">the right tool</a>) is a better minimum viable product that some Kanban/Agile thing you forgot in the first week because you wanted to know more about <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a>.</p>
<p>Today is <b>X-Day</b>. It is a term used by the parody religion <a href="http://www.subgenius.com/" title="Praise Bob!">The Church of the SubGenius</a> to describe Doomsday, but I use it to state when my deadlines are.  Every day has been sort of an X-Day during this pandemic. More so on the days when emotions are high because the elected leaders had decided to sew discord.  My hometown was no immune to the chaos. There was much protesting outside the police department where an undercover police officer hit someone with his car, and thanks to "qualified immunity" the law seems to think he can keep doing it, which is completely wrong.</p>
<p>So if my semi-liberal thoughts get mixed into this blog it is within reason to find an outlet to address these grievances on a platform that I have control over in a world that is out of control in a time when "social media" and "cesspool" appear on the same page of a thesaurus.</p>
<p>With that said, there is no excuse for why LightniNG isn't ready yet. It is my own fault for not having the full product available yet. However, I do have other things to offer.</p>
<p>First, sometime this afternoon I want to upload to my Github a subproject called <a href="https://github.com/jrcharney/cloudburst">Cloudburst</a>.  Cloudburst was a successful experiment that allows for pulling up the current weather observations and warning in a command line interface.  I seem to have better experience writing shell scripts than I do graphical user interfaces.  Sometime within the next year, I hope to get two computers, a new laptop and a desktop arrangement to remote into sometime to have a better working environment. It's hard to make an application on a 13 inch laptop, even if it is a Dell XPS.</p>
<p>Second, also this afternoon or within the week, another Github project called <a href="https://github.com/jrcharney/skyfall">Skyfall</a>, which aims to create an interface that uses Sequelize and PostgreSQL to build a mapping application using Leaflet.</p>
<p>Third, which I hope to remember, fix the thing I was going to do on this blog. There was a a paginating widget that I worked on a couple of weeks ago, and forgot about it. The reason is related to the fourth item on this list.</p>
<p>Fourth, figure out how to use Vim as an IDE. It is very much possible. I've managed to do this in parts. I know that it works because the <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">Asynchronous Linting Engine</a> plugin for Vim was making calls out to <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>. So now ESLint is included with my project and there and <code>.eslint</code> file to prove it.</p>
<p>I'm in my element working in the command line. All this is running or is being stored on a cheap $55 Raspberry Pi 4 I bought at MicroCenter.  And rather than having to be nagged by Visual Studio Code's update notifications, I can update that stuff whenever I feel like it and I won't get any guff about it.</p>
<p>Having this external computer allows for the security and reliability of being able to pick up when I last left off.  As of this post, the Raspberry Pi has been running for about 19 days. Throughout the project, I have been taking notes. Sometimes rewriting some of the documentation in a more mnemonic format which I hope to sanitize and upload to Github in the near future because I took it upon myself to scrap some of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/">JavaDoc</a> (which is now on version 15!) from a disorganized mess of 4300+ classes which had no singular means of lookup into <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">Markdown</a> notation which I would eventually like to migrate to SQL format and do likewise with other languages.</p>
<p>There needs to be a single common Rosetta-style repository that provides a means of translation and documentation for source code.  But that is a project for the long term and not what I am focused on today.</p>
<p>So what is the "Pivot" part of this project? As I had mentioned, I want to shift from Angular to Express. Express is used by most of the popular frameworks (Angular, React, Vue), and just about every example I come across has stuff that uses Express.</p>
<p>The way Angular explains routing (that LaunchCode faltered with in that department) is that everything runs on a single-page application (SPA). This is problematic as your hands are kind of tied to one location unless you can set up the routing, and the other reason Angular doesn't explain it very well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Express has a straightforward explanation which aligns with what I learned with Java Spring Boot. You set what kind of request you want (mostly <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> which correspond with <code>get()</code> or <code>post()</code>), you tell it the path ("route") where it should happen and what function to run when it goes there.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://sequelize.org/">Sequelize</a> seems to apply itself similar to how Hibernate is used in Java with Spring Boot, linking the database with the application. (Spring <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/Model.html">Model</a>. Sequelize <a href="https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html">Model</a>.) I'm certain there is some form building. It just feel like a lot of the same stuff I picked up while learning Java could have been applied in another class for Node and JavaScript. It would probably be an advanced course. An LC201 class, if it ever existed.</p>
<p>I almost wrote an app that used <a href="https://node-postgres.com/">node-postgres</a>, until I found out that the tutorial I was following for that wanted me to use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, of which why would I use a website to access something of which I have access to the command line with, and could possibly be using something other than Okta (or nothing at all) to get my app working, which is what I wanted in the first place.</p>
<p>That seems to be all the news I have for the moment.  If I had more time and had more experienced with the tools that I learned about that were not part of this course that provide some better functionality than the ones that were suggested, and if we were working in a team (which this pandemic has certainly tripped up significantly), there probably would be a completed product.  On the other hand, it might not have been my project but someone else's project.  And what's more practical? An app that generates a character for some <abbr title="Role-Playing Game">RPG</abbr> or an app that looks up the weather using <a title="Geospatial Information System">GIS</a> services?</p>
<p>As much as I like games, I like applying science to practical business decisions and editing code even more.  If I wanted to make toys, I would have signed up for a carpentry class at the community college.</p>
<p>I hope to get this job done very soon.</p>
