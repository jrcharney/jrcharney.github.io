<h2>Stumbling and Recovering Outside the Gate</h2>
<p class="date">August 14, 2020</p>
<p>Not every project is perfect. Sometimes there are mistakes along the way.</p>
<p>As I am writing this post, I am still trying to work out some of the bugs to make this site more modular.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"><code>fetch</code> API</a> has allowed JavaScript the ability to make functions that behave similar to the <code>include</code> statement used in PHP, but it s not perfect.</p>
<p><s>If you opened this website up for the first time, you may have noticed some posts were out of order. While I have done my best so far to fix this issue, even going as far as impose more refined definition of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await">asynchronous functions</a>, it appears I need to impose some sort of delay between each step loaded.</s></p>

    <p><b>Update!</b> Fixed it. It should be better this time.</p>
    <p>I should start thinking about how to have each post appear as if it was on its own page, or showing a short version of a long post, and viewing a set of post one page at a time.</p>

<p>What's more, in part of yesterday's article (link pending for individual pages), you may have noticed I added a new feature: Slide shows.</p>
<p>I was certain that I successfully built this application. I worked perfectly when I tested it on localhost, but something must have happened to throw off its appearance and functionality.  This is an issue I would like to fix in the near future as it described important steps on how to set up the Samba share sequence.</p>
<p>I'm also considering refactoring the code I used in that sectional feature that is more JSON based.</p>
<p>So why does this all work now?</p>
<p>In the past, I had an employer task me with a similar assignment, but I was not aware of the <code>fetch</code> API and he was not aware that due to changes in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS policy</a>, the slideshow application he wanted was not feasible. In order for any of that to work, everything had to be on the same domain. This was not possible considering one of his other requests was to use the obsolete <code>&lt;frames&gt;</code> tag. I talked him into using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, but that was just as bad.  One feature doth not make for a marketable application anyway. Not without an adminstrative interface and persistent storage anyway.</p>
<p>Speaking of apps with persistent storage, <a href="./lightniNG">LightniNG</a> should have a front page up today. It's hard to focus when there's almost 800 tabs open. So, I've got to clear some of that out, and do some Liftoff, stuff by the end of the day.</p>
<p>I probably should have though about adding timestamps to my articles. Besides, making a blog library that simply does stuff rather than using some WordPress thing allows me to make things by my rules.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should rewrite my posts in Markdown? I had planned on making my own version that had a ton of stuff, but I've put a pin in that.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've got to take care of some wire framing, and get a resume form filled out.</p>
<p>I also need to figure out how to get JavaScript to generate a list of files from a directory. I don't think I can do that with <code>fetch</code>. I though I could do it by looking up how jQuery did it, but I spent hours trying to dismantle a copy of a JavaScript file that's never heard of ES6. I'd rather write my own thing as a very short library than some nebulous generic thing.</p>
<p>The less Node there is, the better even though Node is good.</p>
