<h2>A Use Case for User Stories</h2>
<p class="date">August 20, 2020</p>
<p>If 2020 has proven anything, it is that we live in <a href="https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/Darkest_Timeline">The Darkest Timeline</a>. And in this darkest timeline, the CIA has done nothing to fix anything, probably because they were replaced with the evil versions of themselves. And so the chaos continues. At least for another 75 days. (I should add a timer module.)</p>
<p>In order to negate The Darkest Timeline, we must do three things:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>We must grow beards...or at least cut one out of felt.</b> This way our evil doppelgängers can't imprison us their alternate timeline while they cause chaos here.

    </li>
    <li><b>We most remove the evil doppelgängers by any means necessary!</b> Voting is is not enough, but it is a must and a mandatory action.</li>
    <li><b>We should write a story that expresses the hero's journey...or in this case describes what our program does.</b> Basically, this is the premise of this article. All other details are meant to draw your attention and to express creativity, which you need in order to write a story.</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of Liftoff is about writing a program like a story. A <b>user story</b>, sometimes called a <b>use case</b> is pretty much a short story that describes what a feature of your program does.  The program itself is the story. A feature mearly a chapter or episode.</p>
<p>While writing a user story, I</p>

<p>Just like the Harmon Writing Circle, a user story has eight parts, divided into two hemispheres: The Order and the Chaos. Withing the top half of the circle (steps 1, 2, 7, and 8) is the <b>order</b>, the ordinary, familiar world.  The bottom half of the ciricles (steps 3 through 6) is the special world where there is chaos. The climax happens at least once in this hemisphere, but theres bound to be several smaller climaxes along the way. Plot points that can flesh out your story within the the proximity of the major plot.</p>
<p>So how do we apply this to writing a feature for a program?</p>
<h3>Step 1: The Comfort Zone</h3>
<p>Like any good story, there is the <b>comfort zone</b>, which describes the set up of our character. In this case the character is <b>you</b>. As the user of this program, you are the main character of this story. You describe yourself and how you are.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Need or Desire</h3>
<p>But there is a <b>need</b> or <b>desire</b> you wish to fulfill. It could be physical, emotional, or mental.</p>
<h3>Step 3: The "Go!" Phase</h3>
<p>To fulfill that need, the character must place themselves in an unfamiliar situation. Imagine if you were in a car accident for the first time. What would you do?</p>
<h3>Step 4: The Search</h3>
<p>To resolve their position of awkwardness, the character <b>searches</b> for a solution to their unfamiliar situation and learns how to adapt. This is sometimes called <b>adaptation</b>.</p>
<h3>Step 5: The Find</h3>
<p>Having adapted to the situation, the character appears to finds what they think they are looking for. Having choose the Occam's Razor solution, they assume their quest is complete and that the journey is over...</p>
<h3>Step 6: The Take</h3>
<p>...but there is a price for taking shortcuts. While the Harmon Circle looks evenly spaced, this is the area where step 6 can get complicated having to need to start a sub-circle if a side quest or secondary, ternary, or other number of plot happens. These should happen quickly, but they are likely within this sector of the circle until the cost of choosing the most parsimonious solution is negated and the more satisfactory solution allows for the user to proceed to the next sector.</p>
<h3>Step 7: The Return to Comfort</h3>
<p>The story returns to the hemisphere of order and the character...</p>
<h3>Step 8. Change</h3>
<p>...having changed or learned something from their experience. Or they could have learned nothing at all. It depends on the results. Some people can learn something profound from the experience, while others return the to the status quo.</p>
<hr>
<h3>So how can we relate these steps to a user case?</h3>
<p>In order for this method to work, our user case must</p>
<ol>
    <li>Present what is ordinary.</li>
    <li>Describe a conflict to resolve. (The need.)</li>
    <li>Execute a solution.</li>
    <li>Try out several solutions.</li>
    <li>Show the results of each option.</li>
    <li>Decide on the best solution.</li>
    <li>Produce a satisfactory result.</li>
    <li>Accept these new changes as the new ordinary.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there is a more eloquent way of describing this list. That is why the circle is often refined and edited.</p>
<p>Once you have your story, you can wireframe your project to sketch out what it looks like.</p>
