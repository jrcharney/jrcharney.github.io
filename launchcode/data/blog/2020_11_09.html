<h2>We Now Return Back to Our Regularly Scheduled Program</h2>
<p class="date">November 9, 2020</p>
<p>The election of a new president who won't put down others even if there is disagreement; who won't dispute science if it doesn't agree with political party, the economy that rewards only the wealthy with more wealth, or an Evangelical Christian movement that is far from Christian; who won't plunder services that help the downtrodden to serve himself, his family, and the inner circle of plundering associates who he will disown the minute they are caught; who won't abuse the internet and social media while trying to allow for such abuse to serve him for litigious motives; who won't treat women, minorities, LGBTQIAs, the disabled, immigrants, and non-Christians as unequals except in the case where it benefits his image or political position.</p>
<p>There will be those who argue that the things the president-elect has done in the past will still be applied in the future. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act">The 1994 Crime Bill</a>, the confirmation of Clarence Thomas despite the testimony of Anita Hill, the plagiarism in the attempted run in 1988, and his position on immigration under Obama being huge blemishes. Considering what the current adminstration has done, many of those faux pas will likely be rectified. Many of the actions of the crime bill can and should be overturned since we now know that they were morally wrong and intended to establish a for-profit system of injustice that has made police more bias and prisons maintain their populations in order to exploit cheap labor. A more hard-conservative SCOTUS that will be misused by Congress as a means to override Checks and Balances. A first lady who cribbed from her predecessor on multiple occasions.  An immigrations program that has made the system under Obama seem acceptable, more so with the separation of families, the deportation of Americans, the separation of children from their parents never to be seen again.</p>
<p>This adminstration has committed many atrocities, none of which will be immutable, none of which should be pardoned.</p>
<p>The only reason the current president is using the courts is to stave off the inevitable, but it will do him no good.</p>
<p>In the future, those who had suffered the most will return as adults seeking closure if not revenge. While revenge will not fix anything, closure will bring some solace.</p>
<p>We have a world to reunite with. Bonds broken out of hate in a time when we needed to be amicable will need to be reestablished. It's strange how working with our allies is somehow some "global conspiracy" or that "they owe us for all the help we gave them", but our foes deserve an olive branch for how they operate because their leaders punish the slightest divergence of opinion or opposition to fealty as disloyalty.</p>
<p>This adminstration opened a part of the marketplace of ideas that will be impossible to close without being seen as censorship of free speech despite every product that store sells being made out of poison, hazardous materials, and more safety recalls than a hoverboard with lithium batteries.  That store right now is having a fire sale, in that it would like the rest of the marketplace to be set on fire.</p>
<p>This adminstration brought out a part of this country that laid dormant for years, waiting for the day to allow their hatred, vitriol, and violence to take a foothold in the world again. They spoke of civil war, "race war", and accelerated eschatology in hopes that a divine force will come to recognize them as righteous, more so if they were able to punish those who they see as wicked. These ideas are far from Christian.  It is up to the Lord to decide judgment. Killing in the name of the divine isn't holy, it's homicide. Something this adminstration clearly has much experience in considering the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">243,000 people who have died, and the over 10 Million people made sick or disabled</a>.</p>
<p>We will learn that this adminstration perpetuated this pandemic as a means of divine judgment rather than what it was: a pandemic.  They kept saying it was "just the flu". (It wasn't.) The horrible truth will be revealed that we disabled the parts of national security that <i>actually</i> work (customs) to push the parts that don't (border patrol), and blame other countries for the virus that may have started there, but was better handled in the country of origin than here.</p>
<p>Scientific agencies that could predict or prevent the disaster from accelerating to this level were kneecapped. This adminstration was so petty, it punished a weather forecasting office in Alabama for correcting the president's misinterpretation of a forecast map. The National Weather Service is now lead by a climate change denier.  The president-elect's adminstration should restore this service's leadership within his first 100 days. We can have dissenting opinions on scientific theories, but we cannot have people put in charge or vital organizations when the evidence is staring at us in the face. The Wildfires. The Hurricanes. The floods and droughts. I live somewhere where this time of year the average high is in the 50s this time of year. I've slept with the windows open in my home for the past week because the night time lows didn't even go below 50 degrees.</p>
<p>No doubt that over the next few month, those opposed to this change of adminstration will behave violently, more so than any of the protestors who had been attacked with war-weapons by local law enforcement over the last year, or the violence massacres that were done by racist individuals before the pandemic.  It should alarm ever federal agency that monitors this sort of stuff. Last month there was a plot by a militia to kidnap the governor of Michigan because she established quarantine efforts in her state, which were protested by the same people and who invaded the state capital armed to the nines.</p>
<p>Growing up in the shadow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing">Oklahoma City</a>, you would have thought that others would have grown up and learned about the evils of domestic terrorism as they would of 9/11 showed us the evils of foreign terrorism.  But the ideas of "American Exceptionalism" and "Patriotic Education" (which is what actually shaped hwo history was taught following the Wilson Administration for decades) continues to perpetuate the justification of bigotry. Because of such lessons, many of us don't know of our own actual history, the history of state and local communities, or even significant events that we wish would have been taught in school for us to create a better society.  I think most of us probably didn't know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre">Tulsa Massacre</a> until we watched HBO's <i>Watchmen</i> in the past year. And many of us still don't know about the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_MOVE_bombing">in 1985 the Philadelphia Police Department executed a tactical airstrike on an anarcho-primative group but ended out setting an entire neighborhood on fire</a>.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future? On one hand, having an adminstration that doesn't follow the far-right means there is some stability, but the ghost of the past means we cannot let our guard down. A Pandora's box was deliberately opened by the Trump Administration, and the Biden Administration will need to be prepared for the many incendiary attempts to cause destruction.</p>
<p>Terror will not define us. Many will try to cause destruction and blame it on growing leftist movements seeking to re-establish social programs (which many will call "socialism", as if that's a bad thing).  But as much as the left protests, most if not all of their requests were not made with threats of violence.</p>
<p>For the left to regain the trust of all people, they need to speak in a language that implores the urgency of a roll out of social programs with as minimal bureaucracy as possible. The fact that we live in the computer age and approval processes move at the speed of pre-industrial revolution America is ridiculous and expensive. It is possible to compose programs, many of them with automation, to quickly, efficiently, and securely execute the approval process, prevent fraud and excess, and catch grift even if parts of the program are intentionally disabled by another Trumpist.</p>
<p>If necessary, this blog will offer such means to create such programs.</p>
<p>The idea that such things can't be done, except when it benefits the politics of one party, group, or cabal, or person, is nonsense!  More so when the legal process is being criticized for not being "legal" enough by the very people who cut out the confirmation process that promotes confidence over doubt, more so by people who committed fraud over the last few years.</p>
<p>We can build a new system that works, and defy the naysayers who see that their time of exploiting the system for their own selfish needs is over and the law should work to benefit everyone not for a select few while they use it to punish the many.</p>
<p>A functional government is necessary for the safety and welfare of all people living in a country.  Opposition to government can be expressed with dissent and protest, but an appeal to force and threats are not acceptable.</p>
<p>We have 72 days to write this new program, and lint it of exceptions and errors.</p>
<p>Life will return to normal in the future, but we must be more vigilant of people creating chaos from now on.</p>
