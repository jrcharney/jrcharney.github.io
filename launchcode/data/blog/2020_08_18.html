<h2>Master of Style</h2>

<p>There is something about a font that elicits a feeling or sensation.</p>
<p>So if things look a little different, its probably because I've started using Tahoma and Verdana.  There are a few demoscene websites that use it. I suppose if I was using a Mac, I would probably include Monaco.</p>
<p>An effort is being made to fix the August 12 article that had a slide show in in. I wish I knew what broke it.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to replace some of the HTML with some embedded JSON. (I think that's what JSONP is for.)  I've also thought about constructing a new JavaScript module that generate HTML elements. I really should be working on Typscript and my capstone project. But the more I read up on the requirements, the more I feel things need to be in JavaScript.  But then I remember TypeScript is processed into JavaScript so that should be OK. It's just on happening on this part of the website.  Maybe in the future I can rebuild this website to be more of an Angular project.</p>
