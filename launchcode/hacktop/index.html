                    <h2>July 27, 2020</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this page is a long time coming.</p>
                    <p>I've had <code>jrcharney.hacktop.io/hacktop</code> in embosed label tape on the back of the lapdock part of the hacktop for years. Only now have I finally got around to making this page to talk about my device.</p>
                    <p>The great thing about is is that upgrades are easy. You don't like how the OS is? Swap out a microSD card and start over.  Depending on where you get microSD cards, you can get them for cheap. MicroCenter is my goto place for that. Recently got a 128GB Class 10 microSD card for about $12. (Mind you it is their store brand. But their brand is pretty good.)</p>
                    <p>One thing I would recommend is have another Raspberry Pi around in the event things get dicey. There's no way you can fix things with a Windows machine since Windows will only recognize the boot partition but not the partition with your data on it. So have another Pi on hand with a USB micro SD card reader when the you know what hits the fan.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of fans, I would recommend using the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/fan-shim">Pimoroni fan shim</a> if you are using a Pi4. The fan is very quiet.</p>
                    <p>In order for the Pi to not shut down when you close the lid, it is recommended that it run on a separate power supply. When I first started this project, I was a fan of the Anker power supplies, but for some reason just about every company has it set up that you can't charge the powerbank while using it. Something about wear and tear or something, I forget. I'll post something about why that is later.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I just want to make this page. Photos will ensue.</p>
                    <p>What I will say is that I upgraded to a 4GB Pi 4 model, which is probably the second most powerful Pi next to the 8GB which wasn't available at the store.</p>
                    <p>The other change, I am using Manjaro Linux ARM 20.06 at the time of this writing.  I wanted to switch to an Arch-based Linux because so much awesome stuff I saw on Reddit's UNIX Porn forum (/r/unixporn). I'm a big fan of pixel art and demoscene, but I think a lot of people develop their art on computers that could render a Pixar film when a big part of demoscene is minimalism.</p>
                    <p>Starting next week, I will be participating in LaunchCode (St. Louis) Liftoff.  So for the next 8 weeks or so, stay tuned to this website (not this webpage necessarily) for project news.</p>
                    <p>While this page is about the hacktop, sometimes I won't use the lapdock and run my Pi headless over SSH and VNC. More so since Manjaro has an emphasis on being used with end-user devices (clients like personal computers) rather than servers. But I won't let that define how I use linux.  Useing it headless will also allow me to simply share my Linux machine in VNC or SSH in Zoom Screen shares rather than the hassle of swapping between windows programs. So network your computers together. Eventually, we'll find a way to have people work together on the same machine as linux machines can do that.</p>
                    <p>That's all the news for now. Big things are coming here! Stay tuned!</p>
